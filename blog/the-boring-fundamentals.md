Happy New Year! If you’re reading this, I want to thank you for taking the time for the first issue of 2023. Also, for my newsletter subscribers, you’d know I’ve barely kept up with things here. My apologies, I had to fight a few internal battles that I underestimated. That aside, the good news is that I’m back and better, at least for now, I’m sure I believe😉😎.

We’ll start the year with the “The Boring Fundamentals” series. On the eve of the new year, I came across a video by Dan Koe where he covers plotting your world into domination. This issue sort of gained some insights from that video. To shed light on what the Boring Fundamentals is, at least from my perspective, it is the often overlooked but crucial foundation of various fields and industries. In a world where flashy trends and cutting-edge technologies dominate the headlines, it's easy to lose sight of the "boring" fundamentals that are the building blocks of success. But as any expert will tell you, these fundamentals are the key to sustainable growth and long-term success. Whether you're a business professional looking to brush up on the basics of finance or a tech enthusiast seeking to deepen your understanding of computer science, "The Boring Fundamentals" is what keeps you covered, and ahead in your circle. This issue will subsequently delve into the essential concepts and principles that form the foundation of various fields, providing practical insights and actionable takeaways along the way. So join me as I explore the often-unexciting but always-important world of the boring fundamentals.

I started the year with an unusual format, going against the norms or how I've always done it the previous years. I made a decision to not write down my goals for 2023, but instead, I wrote down achievable actions I want to take or execute weekly for the first quarter of the year. For context, I’m a software engineer and creative, so everything is made to align with what keeps me ahead in the industry and as an individual.

The importance of The Boring Fundamentals is often underestimated and misinterpreted especially in today's fast-paced and constantly-evolving world. But as I have come to understand and will tell you, it's the basics that form the foundation of any subject matter, and without a solid understanding of these fundamentals, it's difficult to build a successful career or business. It is quite interesting to add that the greeks in the early times encourage public speaking and open criticism. I think this approach alone, asides from its benefits for a healthy democracy encouraged everyone to take a critical review of any topic, and a necessity for personal growth, and development of individual citizens.

Understanding “The Boring Fundamentals” fosters critical thinking, rhetorical skills, and confidence as an individual. Most importantly, it’s not in any way as exciting or glamorous to put in time or effort.

If you want to set yourself up for long-term success, don't overlook the importance of “The Boring Fundamentals”. Whether you're just starting out in your career or looking to take your skills to the next level, a deep understanding of the basics will serve you well.

Thank you for spending the time to read through my newsletter, it will be exciting to have you write back your review or anything you’d want to share😉👍

Aloha,
David.
